## Lab 1: Linux Process Auditing & Threat Hunting
**Objective:** Identify, investigate, and terminate a malicious background process to ensure system integrity.

### Steps Taken:
1. **Detection:** Used `ps aux` to list all running processes.
2. **Filtering:** Used `grep` to isolate a suspicious `sleep` process acting as a placeholder for a malicious task.
3. **Neutralization:** Executed `kill -9 [PID]` to force-terminate the process immediately.

### Tools Used:
* `ps aux` - Process status (all users)
* `grep` - Pattern matching
* `kill` - Process termination signal
